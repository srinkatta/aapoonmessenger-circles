## Developer Setup and Coding Standards

If you're a developer contributing to this project, follow these guidelines to ensure a consistent and high-quality codebase.

1. **Install Pre-commit:**

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

2. **Run Pre-commit on Every Commit:**

    With pre-commit installed, it will automatically run checks on your code every time you make a commit.

3. **Coding Standards:**

   Ensure you follow the same structure for new apps, creating an "api" folder and organizing API-related components (viewsets, serializers, routers) within it.

   Always prefer small functions over one messy function or class for improved code readability and maintainability.
